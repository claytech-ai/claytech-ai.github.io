        <h1>FROM PREDICTIONS TO DECISIONS</h1>
        The value of data and predictions materialise when they are used to make
        better decisions. Our goal at claytech is to provide the best possible
        data-driven decision-support software. That means breaking free from
        static predictions in dashboards and giving users the flexibility to
        simulate whatever scenario they need to reach their best decision - day
        after day.

        <h1>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h1>
        Claytech offers a declarative query language to specify what information
        to compute. By combining data and business logic, the claytech software
        platform then automatically generates predictive pipelines that compute
        the required forecasts, simulated scenarios, suggestions or warnings. As
        needed, claytech uses techniques from machine learning, operations
        research and probabilistic reasoning to provide the best possible
        information. Applications are built on top of the claytech platform and
        bring it to life by connecting it to specific data sources and encoding
        relevant business logic.

        <h1>CASH FLOW MANAGEMENT</h1>
        For CFOs it is crucial to have a good overview of what their future cash
        flow will look like in order to mitigate potential problems before they
        occur. One way claytech helps CFOs is by simulating scenarios, for
        example, forecasting cashflow given that an important sales person will
        be absent and a major client will have payment delays. Another way
        claytech provides value is by offering suggestions, for example, about
        how much a company can safely reduce inventory. To provide these
        services, the claytech platform integrates different sources of
        information (customer payments, sales, costs, inventory levels, supplier
        payments).

        <h1>ENERGY OPTIMIZATION</h1>
        With organizations facing rising energy costs, facility managers are
        tasked with lowering the energy costs of the buildings they manage. This
        requires identifying potential energy consumption problems and
        introducing new energy saving measures. Claytech helps facility managers
        find causes of excessive energy consumption by, for example, warning
        them when a heating system does not turn off for the night or a building
        is badly configured. Additionally, claytech helps facility managers
        explore ways to reduce future energy costs by simulating the impact of
        candidate energy saving measures.
